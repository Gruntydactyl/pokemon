{"name":"Pokémon Anime Chronology","tagline":"","body":"The aim of this project is to create a maintainable collection of metadata\r\nconcerning the Pokémon anime. This came about due to my frustration when trying\r\nwork out where various movies and specials (and even some episodes) fit\r\nchronologically with regard to the ongoing series.\r\n\r\n## Concept\r\n\r\nThe starting order is based on the original Japanese airdates (taken from\r\n[Bulbapedia][bulbapedia]. Over that is layered a collection of annotated edits\r\nthat can be found in [`data/edits.json`][edits], to form the final presented\r\nordering.\r\n\r\n[bulbapedia]: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net\r\n[edits]: data/edits.json\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nContributions are very welcome! Please provide some reasoning behind your edit,\r\nand if available, a citation. Some common reasons for edits are:\r\n\r\n  - Original/intended Japanese airdates\r\n    - Schedule changes due to real world concerns\r\n  - Continuity Errors\r\n    - Pokémon unevolving\r\n    - Pokémon not having been caught yet\r\n    - Flashbacks to future episodes\r\n    - Mentioning future events in the past tense\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nIt's worth knowing that the movies in particular play it pretty loose with\r\nregard to continuity. It's not uncommon for Ash and his friends to \"forget\"\r\nmajor events that have taken place within them. Some are better than others in\r\nthat respect, but it does mean that while this project seeks to minimise this\r\nsort of thing, it's not always possible.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
